# Friendly settlements

This not an example of good code, just a quick hack, which serves a certain purpose. 
Styling used: Bootstrap.

Usage scenario: a group of friends goes to travel and every person sometimes pays for the whole group or part of it.

The app takes a list of transactions as input.

Output is:
* Actual balance for each person.
* List of payments that have to be made to clear balance. Algorithm guarantees that the count of resulting payments is the smallest possible.
